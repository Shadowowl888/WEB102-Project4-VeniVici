# Web Development Project 4 - *Bark Box*

Submitted by: **Devin Khun**

This web app: **Displays images of random dogs with different sets of attributes. The user is able to select which attributes they want to see.**

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **Clicking a button creates a new API fetch request and displays at least three attributes from the returned JSON data**
- [x] **Only one item/API call is viewable at a time**
- [x] **API calls appear random to the user**
- [x] **At least one image is displayed per API call**
- [x] **Clicking on a displayed value for one attribute adds it to a displayed ban list**
- [x] **Attributes on the ban list prevent further images/API results with that attribute from being displayed**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Multiple types of attributes can be added to the ban list
- [x] Users can see a stored history of their previously viewed items from their session

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Popup side window to add the stored history instead of on the page
* [ ] Show banned attributes on a side popup

## Notes

Some challenges I encountered were from accessing the attributes so that for each dog that is requested, the user is able to ban a certain attribute they do not want to see. It took me a while to figure out how I would implement the banned attributes from appearing in further API requests.
